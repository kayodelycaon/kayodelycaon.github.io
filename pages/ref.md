Kayode is from the Early Modern period (1500 â€“ 1750). He grew up on the savannah with his pack and only adapted to the modern technology later in life. As an adult, he prefers flintlock weapons and bayonets to the bows and spears he used as a child. His one concession to the past is his necklace, which he never takes off, even while sleeping or bathing.

Kayode Lycaon (Kay路o路dee Lie路kay路on) is a gregarious painted wolf living in the questionable habitat of southwestern Ohio. By day, he pretends to be a human, writing software. At night, his paws weave stories from threads spun from the fertile grounds of his imagination.

He writes stories filled with hope and hardship. The ending may be joyful, bittersweet, or tragic but it will always bring the rich inner lives of his anthropomorphic characters to life on the page. He hopes that his passion and creativity will inspire others to tell their own stories.

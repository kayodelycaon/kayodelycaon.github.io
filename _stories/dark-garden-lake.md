Dark Garden Lake is a bittersweet story about Moshi, a cyborg painted wolf, created by the Reclamation Project, who is given the mission to kill the furred folk terrorist, Landolf. He is terribly lonely as he plays a political long game that requires him to take actions that weigh on his soul. He finds comfort in the unlikely arms of a hyena prostitute hired by his handler.

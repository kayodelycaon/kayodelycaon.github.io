This is not a pretty story. This is the story of the deepest regret of my life. A story of going insane and being unable to stop myself from hurting the people closest to me and ultimately losing them.

This the story of when my mind shattered and how my life will never be the same again.

Everything started in January 2018. The previous year, had been full of adventure and friends. I had bought a house in August and celebrated my third year at my day job in October. Then became the con-chair of a furry convention I had been with since I had moved to Ohio. Life was going great.

Little did I know that I had been dealing with a severe case of bipolar since I was ten years old. Twenty-two years through struggle and shear will, I held myself together. Some people with bipolar are primarily depressive end up getting diagnosed after anti-depressants throw them into mania. I am at the other end.

Fueled by stimulants, first Ritalin and later caffeine, I spent most of my life flying high on the wings of mania. While that may sound amazing, I struggled to focus on the things I wanted and the goals I had for my life. Instead, away from anyone’s notice, I spent many nights obsessing over things I didn’t care much for. Never knowing anything was wrong.

When January 2018 came around, the full responsibility of being a con-chair fell on me and I hit the ground running. With the help of my friends and fellow staff members, we charged forward, ready to tackle the new year. This is when I started working a minimum 80 hours per week—40 at my day job, 40 on the furry convention, a pace I would maintain for 10 months. This fueled my mania but eventually the stress started to take it’s toll by summer, I started having panic attacks. I didn’t tell anyone this was happening because I was too busy. So I learned to work through the panic and quickly this became routine.

In August, the extreme stress was eating away at my self-control. During a discussion, I nearly got fired at my job for publicly saying some things I shouldn’t have to a newly-hired vice president. After the fallout from that day, my mind shattered. It was as if a vase containing all of my memories, skills, desires, and goals⁠—all that I am—was thrown into a brick wall and the shards were scattered across the floor. With my mind in pieces, mania took over and the person I was vanished forever.

Mania took me to places and extremes I never would have gone before.

I started reading gay furry erotica, a genre of literature I had deliberately avoided. Pornography was not something I considered acceptable given my conservative Christian upbringing. Any time I became weak and did seek it out, I did so privately and hid all the evidence. All of my computers were clear of any evidence that I had ever strayed into it.

With mania at the wheel, I purchased an entire series of furry erotica off Amazon and downloaded it on my kindle, where anyone who looked could find it. If you’re a reader of the genre, you probably whose books I started with.

If that wasn’t enough, mania had more. I started deeply researching PTSD. Textbook after textbook and stories off Reddit. Far more than any sane person should. The horrors I unearthed only unhinged me more. And then the obsession which had begun with reading, turned to writing.

I started writing a novel about a wolf named Conor, and his boyfriend Donovan. (These are characters I would later recycle a later with different backstories.) The novel was about Donovan rescuing Conor was severe C-PTSD. The backstory he had haunted me for months afterwards. Needless to say, any writing I have of that has been deleted.

Unfortunately, mania was not content with just writing. It had to talk about it. While I didn’t go into great detail, many of the people I talked to had PTSD and I was unaware how much my story upset them. These were friends I had known for five years, some that I had considered family. I hurt them so deeply that, after the convention was over, I never heard from them again.

But before the start of the convention, before I could finish destroying my relationships with everyone running it, psychosis set in. The obsession with researching PTSD and writing Conor’s story turned into a monster. Conor’s horrific reality became my own. His memories became mine. I could no longer separate my body from his. I would look down at my hands and see paws. My tail would get uncomfortably pinched by chairs not designed for it. I had Conor’s latex allergy and my panic attacks worsened.

This should have completely destroyed my life. The only reason it didn’t was a lifetime of hiding pain, my research, and a high school interest in lucid dreaming. From a textbook, I had read about grounding exercises. In high school, I had spent two years doing lucid dreaming and learning about altered states of consciousness. From these experiences, I found ways to cope.

I purchased a necklace that reminded me of who I used to be and wore it constantly. It became my touchstone to reality. Every time I got lost in Conor’s mind, I would touch it and remember the mask I needed to wear. I was no longer human but I was able to pretend to be.

I kept going to work, going to church, and working on the convention. My memory was so unreliable, I had to start writing everything down. Conversations from the previous day would vanish without a trace. Meetings I had had months ago no longer existed. Every day was filled with panic attacks and paranoia. Every miscommunication or forgotten memory became a plot against me.

Then in October, the convention came and I managed the best I could. I was a hollow shell, just trying to survive. When it ended, everything crashed down around me. My friends left and I fell into the deepest depression I had since grade school. Every day, I wanted to die but Conor wanted to live.

Unfortunately, the end of mania was not the end of my psychosis. I continued to be Conor for the next three months. Through Thanksgiving with my family and finally ending halfway through December, when I returned to reality and started to understand what I had lost.

What happened next is a different story. But in summary, a few months later I got diagnosed Bipolar and had to come to terms with who I had been, what I did, and who I had become.

Ahriman238 reads excerpts of On Basilisk Station and includes some of his own commentary,

> She took a quick turn about her cabin. That was one nice thing about Fearless; at less than ninety thousand tons, she might be small by modern standards, but the captain’s quarters were downright spacious compared to Hawkwing’s.
> <cite>On Basilisk Station</cite>

>Fearless mass at 90,000 tons. Not sure if it’s deliberate, but that’s about the size of a contemporary aircraft carrier.
> <cite>Ahriman238</cite>

questions on the material,

> And, finally, Hemphill was one of the most senior admirals of the red. Each of the RMN’s flag ranks was divided into two divisions on the basis of seniority: the junior half of each rank were admirals of the red, or Gryphon Division, while the senior half were admirals of the green, or Manticore Division. Simple longevity would eventually move any flag officer from one division to the other, but they could also be promoted over the heads of their fellows, and with her cousin as First Lord, Lady Sonja was poised to move up to the green—especially if she could justify her tactical theories. All of which, added together, had given Horrible Hemphill the clout to butcher Honor’s helpless ship.

> Wait, I’m confused. Does that mean you go Rear Admiral (red) to Rear Admiral (green) to Vice Admiral (red) or that senior and skilled Admirals are promoted to the elite Manticore Division?

and gets almost snarky at some points.

> McKeon’s description of the alterations was only too accurate, though he hadn’t mentioned that in addition to ripping out two-thirds of Fearless’s missile tubes, the yard was gutting her magazine space, as well. Missile stowage was always a problem, particularly for smaller starships like light cruisers and destroyers, because an impeller-drive missile simply had to be big. There were limits to how many you could cram aboard, and since they’d decided to reduce Fearless’s tubes, they’d seen no reason not to reduce her magazines, as well. After all, it had let them cram in four additional energy torpedo launchers.

I found it quite entertaining.
